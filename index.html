            <p>September 11th, 2001 Attacks refers to the three suicide plane attacks against the World Trade Center twin towers in New York City, the Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia and the fourth plane that crashed into the fields near Shanksville, Pennsylvania.

                Background
                On September 11th, 2001, four commercial airliners, including two Boeing 757s and two Boeing 767s, were taken control of by 19 hijackers. Two planes left Boston's Logan Airport and subsequently crashed into the North and South Towers of the World Trade Center early that morning. One plane left Washington Dulles International Airport in Virginia and crashed into the Pentagon. Another plane left Newark International Airport in New Jersey and crashed into the ground near Shanksville, Pennsylvania after passengers revolted. Within hours of the crash of two planes into the World Trade Center buildings, both North and South towers completely collapsed at 9:59 a.m. and 10:28 a.m. respectively, ultimate resulting in the death of 2,996 people, including 2,977 victims and 19 hijackers.

                Developments
                News Media Coverage
                Media coverage was intense during the attacks and aftermath, beginning moments after the first crash into the World Trade Center. CNN was the first channel to break the news of the attacks, with anchor Carol Lin entering into the middle of a commercial at 8:49 a.m. (ET):





                All day, non-stop live coverage, alternating among New York, the Washington area, Pennsylvania, and elsewhere, was offered by most major U.S. news organizations. On September 12th, 2001, images of the 9/11 attacks were printed on the front pages of 145 news publications across 19 countries. The Internet Archive[21] established a library of television news coverage of the September 11th attacks.

                Viral Media
                As the real-time coverage of the events continued throughout the week, images from the Ground Zero captured by both amateur photographers and photojournalists became prominently featured in the news media throughout the world. On the tenth anniversary of 9/11, National Geographic highlighted 25 photographs in a gallery post titled "25 Indelible Pictures," which included (from top left; clockwise): Spencer Platt's Moment of Impact, Suzanne Plunkett's Running for Their Lives, Richard Drew's "Falling Man", John Labriola's 9/11 Firefighter and Alex Fuchs' Ground Zero (AFP) among others.

            <h1>Nobody cares</h1>
            <p>"See? Nobody Cares" is a catchphrase uttered by character Dennis Nedry in a dialogue scene from the 1993 science-fiction film Jurassic Park. On the Internet, the phrase has been frequently used as a reaction image to convey indifference or apathy towards someone soliciting unwarranted attention.

                Origin
                The memorable quote was originally featured in a dialogue segment from Jurassic Park wherein park employee and computer programmer Dennis Nedry (played by Wayne Knight) teases the head of research lab Lew Dodgson (played by Cameron Thor) for wearing a disguise while meeting at the terrace of a restaurant. A clip of the scene was uploaded to YouTube on July 11th, 2009 (shown below).





                Dennis Nedry: [waving] "Dodgson!"
                Lew Dodgson: [sitting down] "You shouldn't use my name."
                Dennis Nedry: [loudly] "Dodgson, Dodgson, we've got Dodgson here! Nobody cares. Nice hat. What are you trying to look like, a secret agent?"
                On March 13th, 2007, the earliest known online parody of the scene was uploaded to YTMND user keatonkeaton999 in a page titled "Dodgson (fun times mix),"[7] which garnered nearly 180,000 views over the next seven years.

                Spread
                Between 2007 and 2009, more than a dozen additional YTMND pages[8] featuring Dennis Nedry's quote were submitted to the site, though none of them were able to live up to the popularity of the original remix. Then on November 25th, 2012, a two-pane image macro template depicting the dialogue scene was submitted to Memegenerator[1], where it went on to spawn more than 50,000 variations, as of December 2014, during which the rhetorical question "See?" was added for additional emphasis. In 2013, the series continued to proliferate through a number of other image macro generator sites, including Quickmeme [2] and Imgflip[4], with several notable instances making appearances on WeKnowMeme[5], MemeCenter[6] and Car-memes.com.[3]</p>
